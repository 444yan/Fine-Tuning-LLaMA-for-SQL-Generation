// Fine-Tuning LLaMA for SQL Generation

This project fine-tunes a LLaMA-based Transformer to translate natural-language instructions into SQL-style text, demonstrating how large language models can be adapted for structured query tasks.
It highlights the power of fine-tuning to turn a general-purpose model into a domain specialist, enabling users to generate SQL commands from plain English without prior knowledge of SQL.
Developed and trained entirely in Google Colab using Hugging Face and PEFT, the project focuses on efficient training techniques such as LoRA, designed for environments with limited computational resources.

// The Objective

To adapt a pre-trained LLaMA model to recognise and output SQL-specific syntax and structure when given plain-English prompts.

// Key Components

**Dataset:**  
[Llama-2-SQL-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChrisHayduk/Llama-2-SQL-Dataset) containing natural-language / SQL pairs.  
A 1 000-sample subset was used for demonstration.

**Model:**  
LLaMA checkpoint fine-tuned with **LoRA adapters** via **PEFT** for lightweight training.

**Environment:**  
Google Colab GPU with the following stack:
`transformers`, `datasets`, `trl`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, `torch`.

---

// Process Overview
1. Installed and configured Hugging Face and PEFT libraries.  
2. Loaded and shuffled the dataset, selecting a 1 k sample.  
3. Fine-tuned using LoRA within the PEFT framework to teach SQL-style syntax.  
4. Generated sample outputs for unseen prompts to verify structural learning.

---

//  Example Generations
The model‚Äôs generations displayed clear **SQL-like structure** (use of `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.)  
even when not perfectly correct or executable.

Examples included patterns such as:
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 50000
INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (...)
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = ...

These confirm the fine-tuning effectively biased the model toward SQL language form.

---

//  Results
- The model **learned SQL-specific syntax** and keyword structure.  
- Outputs were **syntactically suggestive**, not guaranteed to be executable SQL.  
- The project serves as a **proof-of-concept** in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for structured language tasks.  
- It is **not intended for commercial or production deployment**.

 Future Work
- **Train on the full dataset:** Expanding beyond the 1 000-sample subset would expose the model to a wider range of SQL query patterns and improve generalisation.  
- **Add proper evaluation metrics:** Introduce a train/test split and measure accuracy using metrics such as syntactic correctness or token-level F1 to track learning progress.  
- **Extend training duration:** Running for more epochs and fine-tuning steps would allow the model to converge more deeply and capture richer SQL structures.  
- **Guide the model‚Äôs output structure:** Implement structured decoding or simple SQL templates so that the model follows valid query formats (for example, always producing ‚ÄúSELECT ‚Ä¶ FROM ‚Ä¶ WHERE ‚Ä¶‚Äù). This helps ensure cleaner, more consistent results.  
- **Experiment with larger model variants:** Testing bigger LLaMA checkpoints could reveal whether larger models handle syntax and structure more reliably, offering insights into how model size affects control over output quality.
