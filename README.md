// Fine-Tuning LLaMA for SQL Generation

This notebook fine-tunes a **LLaMA-based Transformer** to produce **SQL-style text** from natural-language instructions.  
The goal was to explore domain adaptation.

Trained entirely in **Google Colab** using the Hugging Face ecosystem.

---

// The Objective
Adapt a pre-trained LLaMA model to recognise SQL-specific syntax and structure when given plain-English prompts.

>  “Show all transactions after June 2022.”  
>  → outputs text resembling a SQL query structure (`SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...`)

---

// Key Components

**Dataset:**  
[Llama-2-SQL-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChrisHayduk/Llama-2-SQL-Dataset) containing natural-language / SQL pairs.  
A 1 000-sample subset was used for demonstration.

**Model:**  
LLaMA checkpoint fine-tuned with **LoRA adapters** via **PEFT** for lightweight training.

**Environment:**  
Google Colab GPU with the following stack:
`transformers`, `datasets`, `trl`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, `torch`.

---

// Process Overview
1. Installed and configured Hugging Face and PEFT libraries.  
2. Loaded and shuffled the dataset, selecting a 1 k sample.  
3. Fine-tuned using LoRA within the PEFT framework to teach SQL-style syntax.  
4. Generated sample outputs for unseen prompts to verify structural learning.

---

//  Example Generations
The model’s generations displayed clear **SQL-like structure** (use of `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.)  
even when not perfectly correct or executable.

Examples included patterns such as:
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 50000
INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (...)
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = ...

These confirm the fine-tuning effectively biased the model toward SQL language form.

---

//  Results
- The model **learned SQL-specific syntax** and keyword structure.  
- Outputs were **syntactically suggestive**, not guaranteed to be executable SQL.  
- The project serves as a **proof-of-concept** in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for structured language tasks.  
- It is **not intended for commercial or production deployment**.

 Future Work
- **Train on the full dataset:** Expanding beyond the 1 000-sample subset would expose the model to a wider range of SQL query patterns and improve generalisation.  
- **Add proper evaluation metrics:** Introduce a train/test split and measure accuracy using metrics such as syntactic correctness or token-level F1 to track learning progress.  
- **Extend training duration:** Running for more epochs and fine-tuning steps would allow the model to converge more deeply and capture richer SQL structures.  
- **Guide the model’s output structure:** Implement structured decoding or simple SQL templates so that the model follows valid query formats (for example, always producing “SELECT … FROM … WHERE …”). This helps ensure cleaner, more consistent results.  
- **Experiment with larger model variants:** Testing bigger LLaMA checkpoints could reveal whether larger models handle syntax and structure more reliably, offering insights into how model size affects control over output quality.
